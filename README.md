# Search-Result-Grabber-API
 Using this API one can grab search result data in json format.

use the url for retriving data, https://ddutta.herokuapp.com/google?country=a&query= {YOUR+QUERY}
 
 so an example can be https://ddutta.herokuapp.com/google?country=a&query=gadgetguys
 It will always return a json response.
 
 Note: the country parameter is not implemented yet so you may put anything in that parameter. Also you may try to implement that and push here.
